# Relationship-Extraction-with-NLP-The-Witcher
In this project, I have tried to build an interactive network between the numerous characters of the fantasy novel series 'The Witcher'. It is about taking text data as input and extracting relationships with the help of NLP techniques/modules, Spacy, Selenium etc, and visualized using Networkx and Pyvis.
