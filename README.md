# Relationship-Extraction-with-NLP-The-Witcher
In this project, I have tried to build an interactive network between the numerous characters of the fantasy novel series 'The Witcher'. It is about taking text data as input and extracting relationships with the help of NLP techniques/modules, Spacy, Selenium etc, and visualized using Networkx and Pyvis. 

This repo contains:


characters.ipynb : Code to extract characters


characters.csv : .csv file that contains extracted characters


relations: contains the social network of all characters 



Lib: Background function that is automated to analyse importance of characters
